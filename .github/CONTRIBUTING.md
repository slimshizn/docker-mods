## Gotchas

* While contributing make sure to make all your changes before creating a Pull Request, as our pipeline builds each commit after the PR is open.
* Read, and fill the Pull Request template
  * If this is a fix for a typo (in code, documentation, or the README) please file an issue and let us sort it out. We do not need a PR
  * If the PR is addressing an existing issue include, closes #\<issue number>, in the body of the PR commit message
